I was invited to present my Masters thesis project to academic staff and students without a physics background at St. Cuthbert’s Society, Durham University.

I presented to this audience the **core concepts**, **aims** and **achievements** of my Masters research project *Jet Multiplicity Measurements at the LHC*.

This meant **adapting** the material of my research and being decisive in the **selection** of pertinent details when **communicating the complex science** that my research concerned and responding to questions.

This was my first foray into presenting the results of my research as a Ph.D. student was an invaluable learning experience.

Shown in the figure is a pivotal set of calculations from my research, the dijet mass spectrum in Higgs boson production at hadron colliders.

In this plot one can clearly see the separation between the Higgs production mechanisms (vector boson fusion or VBF and gluon fusion or GF) which was the objective of the study.

The feedback I received from the convener (Prof. Elisabeth Archibald, then principal of St. Cuthbert's Society) and the audience was **overwhelmingly positive**, with everyone leaving the session with a clear impression of the relevant aspects of my research.
