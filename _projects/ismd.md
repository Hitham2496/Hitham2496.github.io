I was **invited** to present my research (in collaboration with my supervisor [JRA](https://www.ippp.dur.ac.uk/profile/andersen) and [SJ](https://www.ippp.dur.ac.uk/profile/sjaskiewicz/)) at the 51st International Symposium on Multiparticle Dynamics [ISMD](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1015549/) in the Scottish Highlands.

I prepared and gave a 20+5 minute talk to an audience of roughly eighty people from a **wide range of backgrounds** in the field, during the *Forward and Diffractive Physics* stream.

The slides were very well-received by the audience and the **clarity** of their **design** and of my spoken presentation were both highly commended and the talk itself prompted much productive discussion.

My slides are available on [indico](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1015549/contributions/4903854/attachments/2488546/4275047/ISMD-HEJ-Pythia.pdf).
