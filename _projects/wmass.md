At this MCNet summer school we (the attendees) were assigned group projects on determining the mass of the W boson from mock data using Monte Carlo event generators.

As part of the group assigned to [HERWIG](https://herwig.hepforge.org/) I produced the presentation material following our investigation and presented these to the full in-person group of roughly eighty people.

This was a productive exercise in informing my perspectives on presenting work produced within a **large collaboration** which allowed me to further develop my **management** and **communication** skills.

My slides and the investigation results are available on a shared [repository](https://github.com/jcwhitehead/MCNet2022_herwig_Wmass/blob/master/presentation) along with a record of the discussion points raised.
