I gave an **interactive** presentation to postgraduates and academic staff on **good coding practice** including:

- Exporting **Python** code as a local package.<br/>

- The importance and practical implementation of **unit testing**.<br/>

- Adhering to coding **style guides** and using **linter** tools etc.<br/>

- Writing and using **unit tests** as a guide for instructing development i.e. **test-driven development**.<br/>

- Introductory implementation of **Continuous Integration/Delivery** workflows with **GitHub Actions**.<br/>

This talk was pitched to all levels, the aim being that attendees of all backgrounds could stand to gain something from the presented material, which is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Hitham2496/Subtractor).
