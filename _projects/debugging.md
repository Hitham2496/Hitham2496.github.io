I presented to postgraduate students and academic staff the importance of **debugging** when developing code and how to use tools such as <code>gdb</code> in **Linux/Unix** systems to debug practically.

The focus of the talk was on common bugs in **C++** in the context of High Energy Physics (HEP) calculations.

The presentation contained an **instructive** and **interactive** component wherein attendees used gdb to trace through a toy **C++** implementation of a basic calculation in HEP to find the source of a nan-valued output in the calculation.

The presented material - available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Hitham2496/debugging-presentation) - was well received by the audiences and many of those who attended have returned to review the talk to help with their own work following the presentation.
