I gave an interactive presentation on the importance of **profiling** code in **C/C++** and **Python** with an application to computational biology.

The tools used were **Valgrind** for C++ and **cProfile** for Python.

The presentation itself was comprehensive, covering why one would be interested in profiling, how one may profile their code and critically how one may **respond** to profiling analyses.

This also presented newer attendees with an opportunity to see how one can lay out C++ projects (with a Makefile and splitting source and header files)

As with most of my computing club presentations, the presentation included an **instructive** and **interactive** component wherein attendees profiled and inefficient and an optimised implementation of a procedure to calculate the complement of a **gene nucleotide sequence** in **C++** and **Python**.

The presented material - available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Hitham2496/profiling-presentation) - was very well received by audience members of all computing backgrounds and experience levels.
