  title={High Energy and Soft Collinear Resummation for Higgs Production at the LHC},
  author={Jeppe R Andersen and Hitham Hassan and Sebastian Jaskiewicz},
  abstract={We apply our merging procedure [Andersen, Hassan, Jaskiewicz, 2022] to the inclusive production of $H+jj$ final states at hadron colliders and present results that probe the dynamical observables that receive enhancement from effects resummed by the constituent formalisms of High Energy Jets and the parton shower of Pythia.},

  bibtex_show={true},
  title={All Order Merging of High Energy and Soft Collinear Resummation},
  author={Jeppe R Andersen and Hitham Hassan and Sebastian Jaskiewicz},
  abstract={We present a method of merging the exclusive LO-matched high energy resummation of High Energy Jets (HEJ) with the parton shower of Pythia which preserves the accuracy of the LO cross sections and the logarithmic accuracy of both resummation schemes across all of phase space. Predictions produced with this merging prescription are presented with comparisons to data from previous experimental studies and suggestions are made for further observables and experimental cuts which highlight the importance of both high energy and soft-collinear effects.},
