  title={Upcoming: HEJ+Pythia: All Order Merging of High Energy and Soft Collinear Resummation},
  author={Jeppe R Andersen and Hitham Hassan and Sebastian Jaskiewicz},
  abstract={We develop a new method of merging the exclusive LO-matched high energy resummation of High Energy Jets (HEJ) with the parton shower of Pythia which preserves the accuracy of the LO cross sections and the logarithmic accuracy of both resummation schemes across all of phase space. This method improves over previous implementations by ensuring full retention of all emissions produced by the HEJ Monte Carlo, systematically subtracting across the whole of phase space the contribution to the parton shower splitting kernels from HEJ-like splittings. Predictions produced with HEJ+Pythia --- the software implementation of this merging scheme --- show solid agreement with experimental data, improving on each constituent resummation scheme in regions of phase space with non-converging cross sections.},

    abstract= {We present version 2.2 of the High Energy Jets (HEJ) Monte Carlo event generator for hadronic scattering processes at high energies. The new version adds support for two further processes of central phenomenological interest, namely the production of a W boson pair with equal charge together with two or more jets and the production of a Higgs boson with at least one jet. Furthermore, a new prediction for charged lepton pair production with high jet multiplicities is provided in the high-energy limit. The accuracy of HEJ 2.2 can be increased further through an enhanced interface to standard predictions based on conventional perturbation theory. We describe all improvements and provide extensive usage examples. HEJ 2.2 can be obtained from https://hej.hepforge.org.},

    abstract = "{We present all-order predictions for Higgs boson production plus at least one jet which are accurate to leading logarithm in s^/∣p⊥∣2\hat s/|p_\perp|^2s^/∣p⊥​∣2. Our calculation includes full top and bottom quark mass dependence at all orders in the logarithmic part, and to highest available order in the tree-level matching. The calculation is implemented in the framework of High Energy Jets (HEJ). This is the first cross section calculated with log⁡(s^)\log(\hat s)log(s^) resummation and matched to fixed order for a process requiring just one jet, and our results also extend the region of resummation for processes with two jets or more. This is possible because the resummation is performed explicitly in phase space. We compare the results of our new calculation to LHC data and to next-to-leading order predictions and find a numerically significant impact of the logarithmic corrections in the shape of key distributions, which remains after normalisation of the cross section.}",
