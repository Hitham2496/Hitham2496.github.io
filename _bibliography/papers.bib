  author={Jeppe R Andersen and Hitham Hassan and Sebastian Jaskiewicz},
  abstract={We apply our merging procedure [Andersen, Hassan, Jaskiewicz, 2022] to the inclusive production of $H+jj$ final states at hadron colliders and present results that probe the dynamical observables that receive enhancement from effects resummed by the constituent formalisms of High Energy Jets and the parton shower of Pythia.},

  title={Upcoming: HEJ+Pythia: All Order Merging of High Energy and Soft Collinear Resummation},
  author={Jeppe R Andersen and Hitham Hassan and Sebastian Jaskiewicz},
  abstract={We present a method of merging the exclusive LO-matched high energy resummation of High Energy Jets (HEJ) with the parton shower of Pythia which preserves the accuracy of the LO cross sections and the logarithmic accuracy of both resummation schemes across all of phase space. Predictions produced with this merging prescription are presented with comparisons to data from previous experimental studies and suggestions are made for further observables and experimental cuts which highlight the importance of both high energy and soft-collinear effects.},

    abstract = "{We present all-order predictions for Higgs boson production plus at least one jet which are accurate to leading logarithm in s^/∣p⊥∣2\hat s/|p_\perp|^2s^/∣p⊥​∣2. Our calculation includes full top and bottom quark mass dependence at all orders in the logarithmic part, and to highest available order in the tree-level matching. The calculation is implemented in the framework of High Energy Jets (HEJ). This is the first cross section calculated with log⁡(s^)\log(\hat s)log(s^) resummation and matched to fixed order for a process requiring just one jet, and our results also extend the region of resummation for processes with two jets or more. This is possible because the resummation is performed explicitly in phase space. We compare the results of our new calculation to LHC data and to next-to-leading order predictions and find a numerically significant impact of the logarithmic corrections in the shape of key distributions, which remains after normalisation of the cross section.}",
