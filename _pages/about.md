I'm Hitham, a Ph.D. Candidate at the [IPPP](ippp.dur.ac.uk/), Durham University.

I am a talented **researcher** in theoretical particle physics, experienced in **test-driven software development**, techniques in **data science**, and **communicating** the results of my research to **diverse audiences**.

My software development and data science experience includes confident proficiency in **C++** and **Python** with relevant supporting experience in the **Linux/Unix** development environment.

I routinely develop with modern version control systems such as Git (**GitLab** and **GitHub**), making use of **Continuous Integration** to instruct the development of my software according to a **testing-driven** approach.

I have been proactive about nurturing my interests in **climate science**, **data science**, **informatics** and **bioinformatics** outside of my academic career and have kept up to date with developments in these fields by setting myself personal projects.

To further solidify these interests I have sought out and attended courses on **data intensive science** and on the **EMBL-EBI** bioinformatics toolkit (including the **Ensembl** gene database, **InterPro** and **UniProt** protein databases and **IntAct** molecular databases among others).

Additionally, I have demonstrated strong commitment to engaging with **outreach** initiatives to make science as **inclusive** and **accessible** as possible.

I expect to submit my thesis at the end of May 2023 and seek to develop my skills with a **challenging** and **rewarding** career in software engineering and/or data science in industry.

The work I would find most fulfilling would be research and innovation for pioneering companies in fields that produce a positive impact on the world.

In my spare time I enjoy reading fiction, bouldering, running, long walks on the beach and creative writing.
