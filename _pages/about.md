I'm Hitham, a Ph.D. Candidate at the IPPP, Durham University.

I am a talented **researcher** in theoretical particle physics, experienced in **test-driven software development**, techniques in **data science**, **communicating** the results of my research to **diverse audiences**.

My software development and data science experience includes confident proficiency in **C++** and **Python** with relevant supporting experience in the **Linux/Unix** development environment.

I routinely develop with modern version control systems such as Git (**GitLab** and **GitHub**), making use of **Continuous Integration** to instruct the development of my software according to a **testing-driven** approach.

I have been proactive about nurturing my interests in **data science**, **informatics** and **bioinformatics** outside of my academic career and have kept up to date with developments in these fields and setting myself personal projects. I have additionally attended courses on **data intensive science** and on the **EMBL-EBI** bioinformatics toolkit and other pertinent areas to solidify and formalise these interests.

Additionally, I have demonstrated strong commitment to engaging with **outreach** initiatives to make science as **inclusive** and **accessible** as possible.

In my spare time I enjoy reading fiction, running, long walks on the beach and creative writing.
