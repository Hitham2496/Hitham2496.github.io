My software development and data science experience includes confident proficiency in **C++** and **Python** with relevant supporting experience in the **Linux/Unix** development environment.

I develop with modern version control systems such as Git (**GitLab** and **GitHub**), making use of **Continuous Integration** to instruct the development of my software according to a **testing-driven** approach.

I have been proactive about nurturing my interests in **climate science**, **data science**, **informatics** and **bioinformatics** outside of my academic career and have kept up to date with developments in these fields by setting myself personal projects.

Additionally, I have consistently demonstrated strong commitment to engaging with **outreach** initiatives to make science as **inclusive** and **accessible** as possible.

I submitted my PhD thesis on 31 May 2023 and passed my VIVA examination with minor corrections on 19th October 2023, now I seek to develop my skills with a **challenging** and **rewarding** career in industry.

In my spare time I enjoy reading fiction, bouldering, running, long walks on the beach, and creative writing.
