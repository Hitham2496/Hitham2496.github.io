I have been privileged to have had ample opportunity during my academic career to present my research to a wide range of audiences including **laypersons** unfamiliar with my research, other **postgraduate researchers** and **senior academics**.

My presentations have always prompted productive discussion and incurred positive developments in the communities I give them - many have complimented the **easily comprehensible** design of my slides and my **engaging diction** when presenting as well as the well thought-out interactive nature of my computing talks.

Here I list presentations given throughout my time as a Ph.D. candidate at Durham University.
