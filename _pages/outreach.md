I have accumulated significant **supporting experience** throughout my time as a postgraduate
researcher at Durham University, this includes commitment to **outreach** and **EDI**
initiatives as well as **teaching** and **training** courses, and experience
**supervising** students.

## Nuffield Research Placement Supervisor

I volunteered for the [Nuffield Research Initiative](https://www.nuffieldresearchplacements.org/),
which provides research experience to A-level students from disadvantaged backgrounds.

I produced and co-supervised a project on identifying new physics signals at the LHC.

The project was based on producing **statistical analyses** of experimental data and
theoretical predictions, with lessons on **structuring data**, **Monte Carlo methods**,
and the importance of **presenting research** in a **clear**, **concise**, and
**comprehensible** way.

The material created was based on **iPython Jupyter notebooks** which guided the student through
the background and the required calculation.

This material is hosted on my GitLab pages [site](https://hitham2496.gitlab.io/he-pheno-nuffield/).

The project is well-adapted for use in schools and is due to be included in further outreach initiatives
based at Durham University.

## Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion

During my time at the IPPP, I was an active member of the **Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion** (EDI) committee
from 2021-2023, this experience includes:
- Organising, leading, and participating in discussions related to (EDI) in our department.
- Liasing with administrative staff, staff from other institutions to make graduate recruitment process
more equitable.
- Co-drafted code of conduct for conferences at the institute within the context of EDI.


## President of YTF22 Conference Organising Committee
IPPP, Durham University (Sept 2022 - Jan 2023)
- Led the organisation of a hybrid conference of **~80 in-person** and **~40 online** attendees for early career researchers from around the UK.
- Displayed strong **organisational** and **management** skills in **directing a committee** of 10 for the months before and after the conference.
- Secured **funding** amounting to over 5,000 GBP from several sponsors including research groups from the [Institute of Physics](https://www.iop.org/) and other **academic** and **corporate institutions**.
- Ensured smooth running of the conference by **managing the available time** to overcome **logistical** hurdles well in advance of the conference and oversaw the **publicising** of the event to other institutions.
- Gathered experience producing **risk assessments** and taking **health and safety** precautions for large events.
- Co-developed conference **website**, which is hosted by [Indico](https://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/1141/).
